# Publish / Receive Events (Kafka)

Topcoder processes are all event driven. Almost all services generate events that are then published on Kafka - and 
consumed by other services. Topcoder has the [bus api](https://github.com/topcoder-platform/tc-bus-api) that 
interfaces with Kafka already - so you would never find yourself creating a Kafka producer to send events 
in Topcoder's Kafka instance, but you will find uses for Consuming these events from Kafka.

Here is a topcoder starter for communicating with kafka
