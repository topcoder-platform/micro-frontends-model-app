#### What's the path for downloading the Masterscript and Setupscr.sh.

  From the Git Repo from the path [here](https://github.com/topcoder-platform/tc-deploy-scripts.git)

  You don't need to use Masterscript directly. Only ***Setupscr.sh*** is required for management of JSON file variables.

  If you have trouble downloading or need support on script, please contact Gunasekara or Nagendra

#### I need a demo on getting started on Masterscript Release V1.1

  For video demo please refer [MasterScript Release 1.0](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19oGwFm6nNzQeOnM_l79MfdvwcHzWKfsU/view?usp=sharing)

#### Can I leverage development variable JSON file for Production ?

  Yes, you just need to edit the relevant AWS variable and app variable specific to production, validate with masterscript before uploading to production environment S3.

#### I would like to avoid entering variables via deploy script one-by-one, but create all variable values in a json files, Does Masterscript Release V1.1 support this.

  Yes, refer to /setup_ms/variable_file_template/< files> for ECS/EBS/CF and ensure that you adhere to sample_ecs_var.json or sample_ebs_var.json. Note that first section for awsdeployvar is mandatory section.
  
#### Does masterscript Release V1.1 support ECS Fargate deployment ? Which option to choose for this ?

  Masterscript Release V1.0 support both EC2 and Fargate . Just use -p FARGATE

  ```js
    ./master_deploy.sh -d ECS -e DEV -t $CIRCLE_SHA1 -s tcemail-var,tcemail-var-common -p FARGATE
  ```

#### Does masterscript Release V1.1 create necessary ECS or EBS infrastructure like Cluster, Services or EC2 instances.

  No, it is assumed that the relevant deployment infra is available before Masterscript Release V1.0 is executed. But itâ€™s part of Roadmap.

#### What happens, if by mistake I enter incorrect variable or how do I modify, view existing variables.

  There are 2 approach

  1. Find the < filename>.json file at setup_ms folder, manually correct and validate.
  2. Execute ./setup_ms7.3.sh and choose option for modification.

#### Is environment variables are securely uploaded ?

  The json file in-transit is secure via https and at-rest the s3 bucket is enabled with default encryption.

#### How do I leverage common variables files at Masterscript Release V1.1

  1. First create a common variables files adhering to sample_ecs_var.json. The mandatory part of awsdeployvar has to be omitted.
  2. Upload this common file to S3 bucket tc-platform-< env>/securitymanager
  3. At the final step for .circle/config.yml update as following

  ```js
    ./master_deploy.sh -d ECS -e DEV -i $IMAGENAME-t $CIRCLE_SHA1 -s <app-var-file>, <common-var-file>
  ```

#### Troubleshooting: I am unable to validate my json file. Getting error while validating

  1. Ensure that you have installed prerequisite software before validating.
  2. Refer to the /template/ECS/schema_template.json and json file created adheres to this schema.
  3. The easy validation approach is to verify your file at [https://jsonlint.com/](https://jsonlint.com/) and fix any json specific issue before validating at masterscript Release V1.0

#### Why doesn't Masterscript Release V1.1 script automate file upload to S3.

  1. File upload to S3 requires AWS CLI configuration and it can be  either yours or shared  credentials. CLI config and Shared Cred usage situation we would like to avoid.
  2. From Audit trail context, user console upload tracks the file upload
