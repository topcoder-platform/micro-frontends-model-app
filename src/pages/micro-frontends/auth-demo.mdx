# Micro Frontends - Authentication

> We have impleted Authentication in `@topcoder/micro-frontends-navbar-app`, to enable reuse across the micro frontends microapps.

<LiveDemo component={<AuthDemo />} />

## Cross microfrontend export / imports

`@topcoder/micro-frontends-navbar-app` microapp exports functions to be imported by other microapps.
- `login` - redirects to login page
- `logout` - clears session storage and redirects to logout page
- `setAppMenu` - sets sidebar menu for the app by app's `path`
- `getAuthUserTokens` - returns a promise which resolves to object with user tokens `{ tokenV3, tokenV2 }`
- `getAuthUserProfile` - returns a promise which resolves to the user profile object

For example see https://github.com/topcoder-platform/micro-frontends-navbar-app

### How to export

- To export any function we have to `export` in file [src/topcoder-micro-frontends-navbar-app.js](src/topcoder-micro-frontends-navbar-app.js).
- If we want to prepare some function for exporting, the good place to do so is inside [src/utils/exports.js](src/utils/exports.js).
  - We have to bind actions before exporting.
  - It's not recommended to export the whole Redux Store to keep only navbar responsible for updating it. It's better to create promises which would return some particular value from the store.

### How to import

When we want to use methods exported in the navbar microapp in other apps we have to make sure that webpack would not process imports from navbar as it is handled by `importmaps`, see [Cross microfrontend imports](https://single-spa.js.org/docs/recommended-setup/#cross-microfrontend-imports).

#### How to import in React app

For example see https://github.com/topcoder-platform/micro-frontends-react-app

1. Add `@topcoder/micro-frontends-navbar-app` to `externals` in webpack config:
   ```js
   externals: {
      "@topcoder/micro-frontends-navbar-app": "@topcoder/micro-frontends-navbar-app",
    },
   ```

2. As `importmaps` only work in browser and don't work in unit test, we have to mock this module in unit tests. For example by creating a file `src/__mocks__/@topcoder/micro-frontends-navbar-app.js` with the content like:
   ```js
   module.exports = {
      login: () => {},
      logout: () => {},
      setAppMenu: () => {},
      getAuthUserTokens: () => new Promise(() => {}),
      getAuthUserProfile: () => new Promise(() => {}),
   };
   ```

#### How to import in Angular app

For example see https://github.com/topcoder-platform/micro-frontends-angular-app

1. Add `@topcoder/micro-frontends-navbar-app` to `externals` in webpack config:
   ```js
   externals: {
      "@topcoder/micro-frontends-navbar-app": "@topcoder/micro-frontends-navbar-app",
    },
   ```

2. Add type definition in `src/typings.d.ts`:
   ```js
   declare module '@topcoder/micro-frontends-navbar-app' {
     export const login: any;
     export const logout: any;
     export const setAppMenu: any;
     export const getAuthUserTokens: any;
     export const getAuthUserProfile: any;
  }
   ```
