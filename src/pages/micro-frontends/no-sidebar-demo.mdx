# Micro Frontends - Toggling Sidebar

> We have implemented the ability to enable or disable sidebar in `@topcoder/micro-frontends-navbar-app`, allow microapps to implemete their own sidebar if the need arises across the micro frontends microapps.

<LiveDemo component={<NoSidebarDemo />} />

## Cross microfrontend export / imports

`@topcoder/micro-frontends-navbar-app` microapp exports functions to be imported by other microapps.
- `disableSidebarForRoute` - disable (remove) sidebar for some route
- `enableSidebarForRoute` - enable sidebar for the route, which was previously disabled

For example see https://github.com/topcoder-platform/micro-frontends-navbar-app

### How to export

- To export any function we have to `export` in file [src/topcoder-micro-frontends-navbar-app.js](src/topcoder-micro-frontends-navbar-app.js).
- If we want to prepare some function for exporting, the good place to do so is inside [src/utils/exports.js](src/utils/exports.js).
  - We have to bind actions before exporting.
  - It's not recommended to export the whole Redux Store to keep only navbar responsible for updating it. It's better to create promises which would return some particular value from the store.

### How to import

When we want to use methods exported in the navbar microapp in other apps we have to make sure that webpack would not process imports from navbar as it is handled by `importmaps`, see [Cross microfrontend imports](https://single-spa.js.org/docs/recommended-setup/#cross-microfrontend-imports).

#### How to import in React app

For example see https://github.com/topcoder-platform/micro-frontends-react-app

1. Add `@topcoder/micro-frontends-navbar-app` to `externals` in webpack config:
   ```js
   externals: {
      "@topcoder/micro-frontends-navbar-app": "@topcoder/micro-frontends-navbar-app",
    },
   ```

2. As `importmaps` only work in browser and don't work in unit test, we have to mock this module in unit tests. For example by creating a file `src/__mocks__/@topcoder/micro-frontends-navbar-app.js` with the content like:
   ```js
   module.exports = {
      disableSidebarForRoute: () => {},
      enableSidebarForRoute: () => {},
   };
   ```

#### How to import in Angular app

For example see https://github.com/topcoder-platform/micro-frontends-angular-app

1. Add `@topcoder/micro-frontends-navbar-app` to `externals` in webpack config:
   ```js
   externals: {
      "@topcoder/micro-frontends-navbar-app": "@topcoder/micro-frontends-navbar-app",
    },
   ```

2. Add type definition in `src/typings.d.ts`:
   ```js
   declare module '@topcoder/micro-frontends-navbar-app' {
     export const disableSidebarForRoute: any;
     export const enableSidebarForRoute: any;
  }
   ```
