# Where will my application live?

> During development, you application can live almost anywhere (locally, Heroku, AWS, …etc). However - as it matures and moves to production - in most cases, it will live on AWS (that is our current standard). It may help during early development phases to keep this in mind.

On AWS we have several environmental standards catering to various needs:
- ECS for applications that have a “server-side” component
- S3 + Cloudfront for applications that run entirely in the browser and make direct API calls for data (Connect is such an application)
- Lambda + AWS API Gateway (note: serverless.com is our standard for doing this
