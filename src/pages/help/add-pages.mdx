## DOCUMENTATION

### How to Add Pages :

- Write documentation pages in `.md/.mdx` format and add to `src/pages/` directory.
- You may even write `react` components in `.md/.mdx` format and use them in the documentation website.
- Append entry to `src/constants/appMenu.js` in the format :
- To specify custom directory within `src/pages` please add `filePath` as shown in the example

```js
const appMenu = [
  {
    title: "Documentation",
    path: "/model",
    icon: pageIcon,
    activeIcon: pageActiveIcon,
  },
  {
    title: "Help",
    children: [
      {
        title: "How to Add Pages",
        path: "/model/help/add-pages",
        id: "add-pages",
        fileName: "add-pages.mdx",
        filePath: "/help",
      },
      {
        title: "How to document API's",
        path: "/model/help/api-example",
        id: "api-example",
        fileName: "api-example.mdx",
        filePath: "/help",
      },
      {
        title: "How to use MDX Components",
        path: "/model/help/mdx-component-example",
        id: "mdx-component-example",
        fileName: "mdx-component-example.mdx",
        filePath: "/help",
      },
    ],
  },
]
```

- To add a swagger the fastest way is to create a `.mdx` documentation file like the one shown below linking to the original swagger file. Since most topcoder repositories have swagger files already this will ensure **latest swagger is always loaded** in the documentation portal. Example is provided in `./src/pages/help/api-example.mdx`.

```jsx
import SwaggerUI from "swagger-ui-react";
import "swagger-ui-react/swagger-ui.css";

export const ApiExample = () => {
  return <SwaggerUI url="https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json" />;
};
export default ApiExample;
```

### Points to note :

- You can have common pages in `src/pages/common` and use them easily by importing and using them as a component. Example provided in source code is : `copyright.mdx`
- Similarly you can import other `.md/.mdx` documentation files / components into your current file and use as components
- The `id` field can be human readable String or `number` or `uuid` based on admin preference to maintain URL readability vs uniqueness
- The `title` is the title of the document to appear in side menu
- The `fileName` is the name of file added to `src/pages` by admin

### Single SPA application for use as a Documentation

- Primary stack : Reactjs / single-spa application
- **[mdx-js/react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mdx-js/react)** - md/mdx rendering
- **[swagger-ui-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-ui-react)** - Swagger API spec rendering and try it out feature
